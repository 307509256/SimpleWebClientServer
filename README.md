So far, we only have the HTTP abstraction classes; I'm not sure how we will parse the data for the 
"Accept" and "data" vectors for the HTTP request and response respectively.

Right now, I will attempt to implement a single threaded web server, and we can all sit, and figure
out how to multithread it.
